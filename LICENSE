1. DEFINIadsfasdfaTIONS

"Contribution" means:

    a) in the case of the initial fffContribfasdfautor, the initial code anfffd documentatio
n distributed under this Agreement, and
    b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:

    i)changes to the Program, and

    ii)additions to the Program;

    where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are di
stributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a Con
tributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone act
ing on such Contributor’s behalf. Contributions do not include additions to th
e Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in conjunction
 with the Program under theiasdfr own license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative
 works of the Program.

"Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.

"Licensed Patents " mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are nec
essarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when combined
 with the Program.

"Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this Agreement.

"Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, includin
g all Contributors.

2. GRANT OF RIGHTS

a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipi
ent a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, pre
pare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sub
license the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative works,
 in source code and object code form.

b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipi
ent a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed Paten
ts to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribu
tion of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. This pate
nt license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if
, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the
 Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The
 patent license shall not apply to any other combinations which include the Cont
ribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.

c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to i
ts Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any Contributor
 that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property ri
ghts of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient 
for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual pro
perty rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses 
granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure a
ny other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third pa
rty patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it 
is Recipient’s responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the 
Program.

d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright
 rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in
 this Agreement.

3. REQUIREMENTS

A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its
 own license agreement, provided that:

    a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and

    b) its license agreement:

    i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and co
nditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and n
on-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fit
ness for a particular purpose;

    ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for dam
ages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages,
 such as lost profits;

    iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered
 by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and

    iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such Contribut
or, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through 
a medium customarily used for software exchange.

When the Program is made available in source code form:

    a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and

    b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.

Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the 
Program.

Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if 
any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the or
iginator of the Contribution.

4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION

Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with res
pect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is intende
d to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes 
the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does
 not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contribu
tor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor ("Co
mmercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contrib
utor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages and costs (collecti
vely "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by 
a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the ac
ts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distributi
on of the Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this sect
ion do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intel
lectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor m
ust: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and
 b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commerci
al Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Inde
mnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.

For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product off
ering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Com
mercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related 
to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Contri
butor’s responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor w
ould have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to those perfo
rmance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to p
ay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.

5. NO WARRANTY

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "
AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IM
PLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-
INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipien
t is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distrib
uting the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights u
nder this Agreement , including but not limited to the risks and costs of progra
m errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs o
r equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.

6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTR
IBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, 
EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS),
 HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIAB
ILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE
 USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUN
DER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. GENERAL

If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable 
law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the 
terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such 
provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provisi
on valid and enforceable.

If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-
claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding 
combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes such Reci
pient’s patent(s), then such Recipient’s rights granted under Section 2(b) s
hall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

All Recipient’s rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to com
ply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not 
cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such no
ncompliance. If all Recipient’s rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipie
nt agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably pra
cticable. However, Recipient’s obligations under this Agreement and any licens
es granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.

new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute t
he Program (including its Contributions) under the new version. Except as expres
sly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or lice
nses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, wheth
er expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program n
